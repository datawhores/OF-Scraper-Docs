# Auth2222222222222222



## General

You have numerous options for how you want to retrieve auth information. If your able to then I would recommend using the cookie helper option. It requires the least work once setup

### Cookie Helper

Follow the instructions here for how to install in your browser

Select paste from cookie helper all you have to do is copy and paste the output from the program

### Browser Extraction

This is probably the second easiest method. Unfortunately not all information can be auto extracted.

You will still need to go and find the x-bc header and the User-Agent as shown below

For more details you can go to the manual section below, you don't have to worry about extracting any cookie information with this option

## Manual

This option will have you manual fill all the required information

```json
{
    "auth": {
        "app-token": "",
        "sess": "",
        "auth_id": "",
        "auth_uniq_": "",
        "user_agent": "",
        "x-bc": ""
    }
}
```

It's really not that bad. I'll show you in the next sections how to get these bits of info.

#### Step One: Creating the 'auth.json' File

You first need to run the program in order for the `auth.json` file to be created. To run it, simply type `ofscraper` in your terminal and hit enter. Because you don't have an `auth.json` file, the program will create one for you and then ask you to enter some information. Now we need to get that information.

#### Step Two: Getting Your Auth Info

_**If you've already used DIGITALCRIMINAL's OnlyFans script, you can simply copy and paste the auth information from there to here.**_

Go to your [notification area](https://onlyfans.com/my/notifications) on OnlyFans. Once you're there, open your browser's developer tools. If you don't know how to do that, consult the following chart:

| Operating System |    Keys    |
| :--------------: | :--------: |
|       macOS      |   altcmdi  |
|      Windows     | ctrlshifti |
|       Linux      | ctrlshifti |

Once you have your browser's developer tools open, your screen should look like the following:

Click on the `Network` tab at the top of the browser tools:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taux1c/onlyfans-scraper/main/media/network\_tab.png)

Then click on `XHR` sub-tab inside of the `Network` tab:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taux1c/onlyfans-scraper/main/media/xhr\_tab.png)

Once you're inside of the `XHR` sub-tab, refresh the page while you have your browser's developer tools open. After the page reloads, you should see a section titled `init` appear:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taux1c/onlyfans-scraper/main/media/init.png)

When you click on `init`, you should see a large sidebar appear. Make sure you're in the `Headers` section:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taux1c/onlyfans-scraper/main/media/headers.png)

After that, scroll down until you see a subsection called `Request Headers`. You should then see three important fields inside of the `Request Headers` subsection: `Cookie`, `User-Agent`, and `x-bc`

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taux1c/onlyfans-scraper/main/media/request\_headers.png)

Inside of the `Cookie` field, you will see a couple of important bits:

* `sess=`
* `auth_id=`
* `auth_uid_=`

_Your_ `auth_uid_` _will only appear **if you have 2FA (two-factor authentication) enabled**. Also, keep in mind that your_ `auth_uid_` _will have numbers after the final underscore and before the equal sign (that's your auth\_id)._

You need everything _**after**_ the equal sign and everything _**before**_ the semi-colon for all of those bits.

Once you've copied the value for your `sess` cookie, go back to the program, paste it in, and hit enter. Now go back to your browser, copy the `auth_id` value, and paste it into the program and hit enter. Then go back to your browser, copy the `auth_uid_` value, and paste it into the program and hit enter (**leave this blank if you don't use 2FA!!!**).

Once you do that, the program will ask for your user agent. You should be able to find your user agent in a field called `User-Agent` below the `Cookie` field. Copy it and paste it into the program and hit enter.

After it asks for your user agent, it will ask for your `x-bc` token. You should also be able to find this in the `Request Headers` section.

You're all set and you can now use `ofscraper`.
