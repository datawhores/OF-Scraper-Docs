# Downloading Text Files

{% hint style="info" %}
**Text files must be handled differently since there are no text media uploads; instead, they are based on the posts and tied to multiple media**
{% endhint %}

1. **Download Text only**

* **Set the mediatype to only text via the --mediatypes arg or config file**
* **This will work in download and manual,content check mode as well, It will not work in like/unlike mode**

2. **Download Text with other media**

* **Set the mediatype to include text via the --mediatypes arg or config file**
* **Again This will work in download and manual,content check mode as well, It will not work in like/unlike mode**
