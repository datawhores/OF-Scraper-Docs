# Config Location

### Config Path

#### Windows

I'm not someone who uses Windows on a daily basis, but it should be

```
C:/Users/username/.config/ofscraper/config.json
```

#### Linux

{% hint style="info" %}
**If running with sudo or root** \
**Then the file will be located in /root/.config/ofscaper/config.json**
{% endhint %}

```
/home/username/.config/ofscraper/config.json
```

#### Change config location

This can also be changed with the --config option
