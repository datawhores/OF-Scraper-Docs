# Customizing save path

You can adjust the file save path by editing the configuration file.

## Config Path

### Windows

I'm not someone who uses Windows on a daily basis, but it should be

```
C:/Users/username/.config/ofscraper/config.json
```

### Linux

```
/home/username/.config/ofscraper/config.json
```

or

```
/root/.config/ofscaper/config.json
```

where username is your login name

### Change config location

This can also be changed with the --config option

Each file will be saved to `/root/Data/ofscraper/{model_username}/{responsetype}/{mediatype}/{filename}.{ext}`

The placeholders described below will substitute the {} values

### save\_location

This is the root of all saved files

### dir\_path

The  relative directory path within the save location where files are stored

```
{date}=
The creation date of the post, refer to the 'date' section for formatting guidelines. 
Please open an issue if further assistance is required.

{responsetype}=Posts,Messages,Paid,etc

{mediatype}=Images,Audios,Videos

{value}=The content's value: Whether it's categorized as Paid or Free.

{model_id}= Unique identification number for model

{first_letter}= first letter of model's username

{sitename} = Onlyfans

{model_username} = The model's username
{profile} = The currently active profile
{my_username}=The authorized account's username
{my_id} = The identification number 
for the  authorized account
{label} = The label assigned to the post, if available
{download_type}= Indication of whether it's protected or normal, 
determined by the necessity for decryption

```

### Filename

The file's name segment in the saved file\




```
{sitename} = Onlyfans

{first_letter} = first letter of model's username

{post_id} = The posts' ID

{media_id} = The media's ID

{model_username} = The model's username

{responsetype} = Posts,Messages,Paid,etc

{mediatype} = Images,Audios,Videos,etc

{filename} = The media's filename

{value} = The content's value: Whether it's categorized as Paid or Free

{text} = The text within the media. Truncation of file names has been tested to fit within OS limits, 
still it's advisable to establish a text length limit.
{date} = The date when the post was created.
{model_id}= Unique identification number for model


{ext} = The file extension of the media
{profile} = The currently active profile
{my_username}=The authorized account's username
{my_id} = The identification number 
for the  authorized account
{label} =  The label assigned to the post, if available
{download_type}= Indication of whether it's protected or normal, 
determined by the necessity for decryption
Warning
```

```
When configuring filenames, ensure a unique element such as text, media ID, post ID, or filename to avoid conflicts. 
These elements are unique to prevent filename conflicts.
```

### date (optional)

\
The date syntax doesn't use bracket notation; it adheres to the Arrow implementation.&#x20;

For more information, check the documentation at [https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#supported-tokens](https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#supported-tokens). If you need additional help, feel free to open an issue in the repository for support.

### textlength

As a default, it is the maximum number of words. You can switch this to the maximum number of letters by using the '--letter-count' argument.&#x20;

Remember, specifying '0' equates to no limit.

## Remapping responsetype

This feature enables you to group downloads using the 'responsetype' placeholder. It allows combining various download types into a single folder or segregating downloads into separate folders based on their 'responsetype.'

For example, you can merge 'stories' and 'highlights' into one folder or categorize 'purchased' items and 'messages' into a folder named 'Premium.' Another option is to organize 'timeline posts' into a separate folder labeled 'posts.'

The initial value indicates the mapped response type, which should remain unchanged. The second value determines the remapped 'responsetype.'

#### Example

```
"timeline": "posts",
"message": "premium",
"archived": "archived",
"paid": "premium",
"stories": "stories",
"highlights": "stories",
 "profile": "profile"
```

```
dir_format": "{model_username}/{responsetype}/{mediatype}/"
```

```
timeline -> maps to posts -> files save to "{model_username}/Posts/{mediatype}/"
messages -> maps to premium -> files save to "{model_username}/Premium/{mediatype}/"
archived -> maps to archived -> files save to "{model_username}/Archived/{mediatype}/"
paid -> maps to premium -> files save to "{model_username}/Premium/{mediatype}/"
stories -> maps to stories -> files save to "{model_username}/Stories/{mediatype}/"
highlight -> maps to stories  -> files save to "{model_username}/Stories/{mediatype}/"
profile -> maps to archived  -> files save to "{model_username}/Profile/{mediatype}/"
```

These default settings are crafted to ensure maximum compatibility with Digitalcriminal's script.
