# Setting metadata path

In the config.json file, you can modify the default metadata location or adjust where the script searches for database files

Using your existing metadata files from DIGITALCRIMINALS' script enables immediate utilization for dupe checks, with any new files added subsequently being appended to the existing ones

## Config File Location

### Windows

I don't often work on Windows, but the location should generally be.

```
C:/Users/username/.config/ofscraper/config.json
```

### Linux

```
/home/username/.config/ofscraper/config.json
```

or

```
/root/.config/ofscaper/config.json
```

Replace "username" with your login name

## Changing metadata location

Adjust the metadata section in the config.json file by inserting the appropriate locations or paths using the provided placeholders

```
{sitename} = Onlyfans

{first_letter} = first letter of model's username

{model_username} = The model's username.

{model_id}= Unique identification number for model
{configpath}= The directory containing the config.json file
{profile} =The currently active profile
{save_location} = This option retrieves the parsed path specified in the 'save_location' 
option
{my_username}=The authorized account's username
{my_id} = The identification number assigned to the authorized account
```
