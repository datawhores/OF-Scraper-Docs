The simplest method is to execute this command

```
ofscraper
```

Basically, any command lacking a scraping option will trigger the menu display

## Edit Profile

Use this option to

* add profiles
* change the default profile
* rename a profile
* delete profile

Each profile corresponds to a single account. So, if you aim to have multiple accounts, you'll require multiple profiles

## Edit config.json

To bypass the hassle of finding the config file's location, utilize this to modify settings directly from within the script.&#x20;

Your prior choices will be available, allowing you the chance to edit them conveniently.

## Edit auth.json

Typically this is not a setting that needs to be access manually

However, you have the option to directly modify the authentication JSON using this method.

Just a heads-up: if the authentication fails, the authentication menu will pop up, prompting you to enter new settings
