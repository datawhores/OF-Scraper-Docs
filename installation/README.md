## Install via a package manager

{% hint style="info" %}
**pipx is recommended for its virtual environment management capabilities.**

**It serves as an abstraction layer over pip, placing installed scripts within isolated virtual environments. This approach is highly recommended for script installation as it offers several advantages:**

* **Prevents conflicts:** By isolating scripts and their dependencies within virtual environments, pipx effectively eliminates conflicts with other Python packages or system-wide installations.
* **Enhances organization:** Each script resides in its own distinct virtual environment, promoting better organization and clarity in project management.
* **Simplifies updates:** pipx streamlines the process of updating scripts, ensuring you always have access to the latest versions and features

## Compiled Binaries \[No Install]

{% hint style="info" %}
**A pyinstaller based binary is an executable file that contains your Python script and all the necessary dependencies to run it on different operating systems. Pyinstaller analyzes the script and bundles it with the Python interpreter, libraries, modules, and other resources into a single file or folder**
{% endhint %}
