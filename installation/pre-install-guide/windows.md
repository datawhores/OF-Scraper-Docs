**Doesn't Work**\
Move to step 3

**Version Too old**

You should get an output between 3.10.12 to the latest version of 3.12. If not, proceed to step 3 to upgrade to an appropriate version

**Everything Okay**

Move to step 4

### Step 3 \[Optional Maybe]

#### Done

Return to step 2 and retry the process



### step 4

To confirm that pip is installed, return to the terminal and type

```
py -3 -m pip -V
```

You should see a message similar to

```
pip 23.0.1 from /home/john/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)

```

### &#x20;step 5

From now on, all actions related to OF-Scraper will take place in the terminal program. Enter any commands you see within the terminal
