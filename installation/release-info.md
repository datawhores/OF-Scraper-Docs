## Files

### .zip

You can unzip these files, and the resulting folder can be used to run the script by utilizing the file starting with 'ofscraper\_' in your terminal program.&#x20;

The distinction from other releases is that startup might be slightly faster with a zip or directory since a temporary folder isn't generated each time the script begins.
