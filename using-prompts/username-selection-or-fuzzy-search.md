# Username selection or Fuzzy Search

Ofscraper applies a fuzzy search technique to simplify managing selected models. This approximate search aims to find strong matches for the string you input.

However, the challenge lies in determining which models are being selected.

## Selecting a model

For all models

```
ctrl- R
```

For a single model you can hit

```
home+right
```

```
pageDown+right
```

```
 shift+Right
```

## Sorting/Filtering List

You'll be able to adjust the filters which controls the appearance of models on the list and how they're sorted

```
ctrl-z 
```

## Searching the list

It's as simple as typing, for instance, 'example.'&#x20;

The outcome is based on your account and the filters you've implemented.

Entering '1' here filters out all other non-matching options, displaying only '1'.
